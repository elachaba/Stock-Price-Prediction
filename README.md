# Stock-Price-Prediction
Overview

Stock price prediction plays a crucial role in financial markets, and accurate forecasts can have significant implications for businesses, investors, and financial institutions. 

 

Stock price prediction helps investors and fund managers make informed investment decisions. By accurately forecasting future stock prices, investors can identify potential opportunities for maximizing profits or minimizing losses. It enables them to allocate their capital wisely and adjust their investment portfolios based on predicted price movements.


Machine and Deep Learning have demonstrated their potential to enhance stock price prediction accuracy and assist investors, traders, and financial analysts in making informed decisions. By leveraging ML techniques, businesses can gain valuable insights, optimize investment strategies, and improve risk management in stock market's complex and dynamic realm.

 

The prediction of stock prices is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity and volatility of financial markets. Traditional methods often fail to capture the intricate patterns and dependencies present in stock price data. However, RNN and LSTM models have shown great potential in capturing temporal dependencies and making accurate predictions in various time series forecasting tasks.

In this first project of our four-part series, we will focus on implementing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks specifically for the task of stock price prediction. This project serves as an essential foundation for understanding and utilizing these advanced deep learning techniques in the context of financial forecasting.

 

Throughout this project, we will delve into the fundamentals of RNNs and LSTMs and explore their suitability for capturing temporal dependencies in stock price data. We will learn how to preprocess and prepare the historical stock price dataset for training and testing our models.



Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a robust stock price prediction system utilizing recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. We will also understand the fundamentals of deep learning and its application in financial forecasting.

 

Data Description
